\title{Crosswalk ZIP Codes with ZCTA Dictionary}
\usage{
zi_crosswalk(
  .data,
  input_zip,
  dict = "UDS 2021",
  dict_zip = "ZIP",
  dict_zcta = "ZCTA",
  style = "zcta5",
  zip_source = "UDS"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An "input object" that is data.frame or tibble that contains
ZIP Codes to be crosswalked.}

\item{input_zip}{The column in the input data that contains five-digit ZIP
Codes. If the input is numeric, it will be transformed to character data
and leading zeros will be added.}

\item{dict}{A "dictionary object" that contains ZIP Code to ZCTA crosswalks.
This can either be an object in the user's global environment or,
alternatively, a string that corresponds to the vintage of UDS Mapper crosswalk
files to be used. Valid strings are formatted with \code{"UDS"} followed by
a year between 2010 and 2021 so that a complete input looks like
\code{dict = "UDS 2020"}. See \code{zi_load_crosswalk()} for additional
information and to preview these objects.}

\item{dict_zip}{The name of the column in the "dictionary object" that contains
ZIP Code data. This is \code{"ZIP"} by default, but can be changed optionally
to another name.}

\item{dict_zcta}{The name of the column in the "dictionary object" that contains
ZCTA data. This is \code{"ZCTA"} by default, but can be changed optionally
to another name. This could be either a three or five digit ZCTA based
on the \code{style} argument.}

\item{style}{A character scalar - either \code{"zcta5"} or \code{"zcta3"}.
This applies only to the \code{dict_zcta} argument.}

\item{zip_source}{A character scalar that specifies the source of ZIP Code crosswalk
data. This can be one of either \code{"UDS"} or \code{"HUD"}. The default is
\code{"UDS"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with ZCTAs appended.
}
\description{
This function compares input data containing ZIP Codes with
    a crosswalk file that will append ZCTAs. This is an important step because
    not all ZIP Codes have the same five digits as their enclosing ZCTA.
