<p>In the United States, ZIP Codes are used to facilitate postal
deliveries. They are created and maintained by the United States Postal
Service (USPS), but are also required by other shippers and appear in a
variety of administrative data contexts. ZIP stands for “Zone
Improvement Plan,” which was introduced in 1963.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="zip-code-basics">ZIP Code Basics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zip-code-basics"></a>
</h2>
<p>A complete ZIP Code consists of two elements - a five-digit number
and a four-digit number. Together, these nine digits represent a
specific delivery area (sometimes referred to as a carrier route). The
first five digits, which we’ll refer to as ZIP Codes for shorthand,
represent one of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a general delivery area,</li>
<li>a Post Office, to facilitate deliveries to PO Boxes,</li>
<li>or a single high-volume customer, such as a university, federal
agency, or large company.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most common form of a ZIP Code is the general delivery area.
While we imagine these to be distinct, non-overlapping regions on a map,
they are actually collections of carrier routes that sometimes overlap
with each other.</p>
<p>Those individual carrier routes are represented by the second,
four-digit number. These may correspond to a particular city block,
apartment building, or other delivery area within a ZIP Code. For PO
Boxes, individual boxes may be assigned their own four-digit number.
Generally speaking, the four-digit add-on is not especially useful for
RWE.</p>
<p>ZIP codes are assigned to four types of jurisdictions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>states,</li>
<li>the District of Columbia,</li>
<li>insular areas, which include:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>five inhabited territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern
Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and United States Virgin Islands)</li>
<li>as well three independent nations (the Federated States of
Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of
Palau) that are part of the Compact of Free Association (COFA), and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>federal facilities in other countries, most notably Department of
Defense installations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Compact of Free Association (COFA) is a wide-ranging legal
agreement that gives the three nations access to many U.S. federal
services usually considered domestic programs. This includes USPS
deliveries, and so all three nations are assigned ZIP Codes as well.</p>
<p>ZIP Codes <em>generally</em> are patterned regionally, with ZIP Codes
beginning with <code>0</code> being located in the Northeast. Values
increase westward, with the highest ZIP Codes in Alaska, Hawaii, and
islands in the Pacific. These ZIP Codes all begin with a
<code>9</code>.</p>
<p>States are assigned one or more initial digits. For example, New York
State primarily has ZIP Codes beginning with values between
<code>10</code> and <code>14</code> for their first two digits. However,
there are routine exceptions. <code>06390</code> (Fishers Island) is
also a valid ZIP Code in New York even though it begins with
<code>0</code>. Likewise, federal agencies located in Maryland and
Virginia have Washington, D.C. assigned ZIP Codes. The first digit,
therefore, <strong>does not</strong> correspond to Census Region or
Division, and it is <strong>not</strong> possible to aggregate up to
those geographies based on the first digit alone. ZIP Codes also
<strong>cannot</strong> be aggregated to counties or states with
complete accuracy.</p>
<p>Since ZIP Codes are designed to facilitate the delivery of mail, and
not other uses, they do not neatly nest into other jurisdictional
boundaries. They regularly cross county boundaries, and sometimes cross
state boundaries as well, especially in rural areas where postal
delivery is best facilitated from a neighboring state.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to know that ZIP Codes are not permanent.
Carrier routes are updated frequently, and even the ZIP Codes themselves
are subject to revision occasionally. For example, some ZIP Codes have
been split to accommodate population growth and housing
construction.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="three-digit-zip-codes">Three-Digit ZIP Codes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#three-digit-zip-codes"></a>
</h2>
<p>Three-digit ZIP Codes have a specific meaning for the USPS, and are
sometimes also used in patient-level data to preserve confidentiality.
More details on working with three-digit ZIPs can be found in a <a href="three-digit-zips.html">separate vignette</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="zip-code-tabulation-areas">ZIP Code Tabulation Areas<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zip-code-tabulation-areas"></a>
</h2>
<p>The USPS does not publish a map of ZIP Codes because carrier routes
are constantly changing and being revised. Moreover, since ZIP Codes are
not areas on maps as we imagine them, they are not suitable for
aggregation or analysis. The Census Bureau has created ZIP Code
Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) to approximate ZIP Code areas for the purposes
of data analysis and mapping. ZCTAs are created by aggregating Census
blocks that have the same first three digits of their ZIP Codes. This
means that ZCTAs are not the same as ZIP Codes, and they are not the
same as carrier routes. They are a useful approximation for many
purposes, but they are not perfect. ZCTAs are updated every year, though
the most significant updates occur every decade with the release of the
Decennial Census.</p>
<p>ZCTAs are created by identifying the most common ZIP Code within each
Census Block, and then dissolving those individual Census Blocks
together to create a single polygon. This results in misclassification
at the address-level, where some address points within a given Census
Block will be assigned a ZCTA that differs from their individual ZIP
Code. Correcting this form misclassification requires point-level
address data, which may be available in some areas but are not available
for the entire United States. Addressing this problem is beyond the
scope of <code>zippeR</code>.</p>
<p>ZCTAs are not created for areas that have no population, or areas
that have very sparse populations. This affects areas in the American
West, for example, that have very few residents.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that not all ZIP Codes have an
analogous ZCTA. Some ZIP Codes are used for Post Office Boxes, and these
are not included in the ZCTA data. Using ZIP to ZCTA crosswalk files can
help address this form of misclassification, and is the subject of a
separate vignette.</p>

<h2 id="zip-code-and-zcta-formatting">ZIP Code and ZCTA Formatting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zip-code-and-zcta-formatting"></a>
</h2>
<p>One of the core features of <code>zippeR</code> validate inputs of
ZIP codes or ZCTA codes. For example, here are a set of ZCTAs that lie
on the Missouri/Iowa border:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">zcta5</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"51640"</span>, <span class="st">"52542"</span>, <span class="st">"52573"</span>, <span class="st">"5262x"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how the last element contains a non-numeric character. When
<code>zcta5</code> is passed to <code><a href="../reference/zi_validate.html">zi_validate()</a></code>, it will
catch the formatting issue. There are two options, one of which returns
a single logical value (<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">library</span>(zippeR)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">zi_validate</span>(zcta5)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="cn">FALSE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The other option, with <code>verbose = TRUE</code>, provides
additional data about where formatting issues may exist:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">zi_validate</span>(zcta5, <span class="at">verbose =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># A tibble: 4 × 2</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" tabindex="-1"></a>  condition                                   result</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="sc">&lt;</span>chr<span class="sc">&gt;</span>                                       <span class="er">&lt;</span>lgl<span class="sc">&gt;</span> </span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">1</span> Input is a character vector?                <span class="cn">TRUE</span>  </span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">2</span> All input values have <span class="dv">5</span> characters?         <span class="cn">TRUE</span>  </span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">3</span> No input values are over <span class="dv">5</span> characters long? <span class="cn">TRUE</span>  </span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">4</span> All input values are numeric?               <span class="cn">FALSE</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the third and fourth tests, users are strongly encourage to
attempt to manually correct problems. However, <code><a href="../reference/zi_repair.html">zi_repair()</a></code>
can be used to address the first and second tests, and will return
<code>NA</code> values for ZIPs or ZCTAs that do not pass the third and
fourth tests:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">zi_repair</span>(zcta5)</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="st">"51640"</span> <span class="st">"52542"</span> <span class="st">"52573"</span> <span class="cn">NA</span>     </span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" tabindex="-1"></a>Warning message<span class="sc">:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" tabindex="-1"></a>In <span class="fu">zi_repair</span>(zcta5) <span class="sc">:</span> NAs introduced by coercion</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When malformed ZIPs or ZCTAs are replaced with <code>NA</code>
values, <code><a href="../reference/zi_repair.html">zi_repair()</a></code> will return a warning. Note that
<code><a href="../reference/zi_validate.html">zi_validate()</a></code> also works with three-digit ZCTAs as
well:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> zcta3 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">"516"</span>, <span class="st">"525"</span>, <span class="st">"526"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">zi_validate</span>(zcta3, <span class="at">style =</span> <span class="st">"zcta3"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="cn">TRUE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that, at this time, the validation process does not ensure that
inputs correspond to valid ZCTAs.</p>
